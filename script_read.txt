"Please focus the camera on my face as we begin this recording session, specifically designed to capture every possible shape and movement of the human mouth. I want you to imagine a bright Monday morning where my brother Bob is baking a fresh batch of maple muffins in the kitchen. He carefully picks the biggest blueberries and places them into a large yellow bowl while humming a happy tune. Outside the window, five vivid violets are floating on the surface of the very vast river, and the view is absolutely beautiful. I thought about the thirty-three thieves who tried to seize the golden treasure from the royal zone, but they failed because the judge chose to check the gate quickly. It is funny how the smooth birch canoe slid on the planks near the dark blue background, while the white snow looked like silver sheets covering the ground. We saw three boys eating sweet cake near the sharp edge of the garden, and they were laughing at the lazy brown wolf who was trying to breathe through a thin cloth. Please leave the keys on the sleek steel sheet by the sheep, because the goose is loose and running wildly through the spruce grove. Who threw the blue shoe into the cool pool near the school? We may never know, but surely the vision of the beige garage is just a mirage. I am speaking slowly and distinctly so that the system can learn the difference between words like sheet and shoot, or fame and vain. Now, watch my jaw move closely as I count clearly to ten: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, and the sphinx judges my vows with great care. This concludes the video capture."
